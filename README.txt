I.2 Security concerns
Because you are creating a fully working website, there are a few security concerns that
you will have to tackle
• Any password stored in your database must be encrypted
• Your website must be protected against SQL injections
• You must implement some kind of server-side validation for forms and any user
input
I.3 User Account

• A user must be able to choose a unique name that will be displayed on the website
• A user has several victories and losses and other stats (ladder level, achievements
etc...)
• A user must have an avatar generated or uploaded by the user
• A user must be able to activate a 2-factor authentication (like google authenticator
or an SMS etc...)
• A user can add other users as friends, and see their current status (online, offline,
in a game...)
• Each user has a match history (including duel, ladder) that can be consulted by
anyone logged-in
I.4 Chat
• Users must be able to create channels public/private or protected by a password
• Users must be able to send direct messages to other users
• Users must be able to block other user and therefore they will not see their messages
anymore
• A user that creates a new channel is automatically its owner until he leaves the
channel
◦ owner of a channel can add/change/remove a password to access the channel
◦ owner can select a user to be an administrator and is also an administrator of
the channel

I.5 Game
The main purpose of this website is to play pong against other players and show everyone
how good you are!
Therefore we should be able to play pong directly on the website and live against
another player.
There must be a match-making system, user can join a game queue and are automatically matched with another player.
It can be on a canvas or it can be with 3d effects, it can be ugly but it must be a
pong like the one from 1972.
You need to have some game customization options (power-ups, different maps etc)
but the user must be able to play a default pong game without any added stuff.
The game must be responsive!
Other users can watch the game live without interfering in it.
Think about network issues, like disconnects or lag. The user
experience should be the best possible.
